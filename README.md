# customer_portal
The customer portal is a WORK IN PROGRESS and is intended to create a better workflow for my company Cogwork Consulting Group (www.cogworkconsulting.com) and its customers.

Customers will be able to make new jobs, define due dates, and maintain version control with the labels and files that I produce for them.
